    "courseDescContent": "For data owners from various disciplines, in order to verify inferences or discover new information, visualization has become a powerful means to help them understand and display data. The logic of visualization is to use our interpretation capabilities through visual perception channels, and to encode data information into images and graphs to improve our understanding of data. Computer science, mathematics, cognitive and perceptual science, and physics techniques are often transformed into various visualization problems. This introductory course covers topics in many visualization sub-fields including information visualization and scientific visualization, and aims to show students how data visualization can help find solutions to practical problems in the process of data analysis in various fields. Through this course, students will be familiar with some visualization techniques and methods for displaying different types of data, and cultivate the ability to quickly use visualization-based methods to respond to problems when they encounter actual problems.",
