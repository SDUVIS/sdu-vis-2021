    "en": "For data owners from various disciplines, in order to verify inferences or discover new information, visualization has become a powerful means to help them understand and display data. The logic of visualization is to use our interpretation capabilities through visual perception channels, and to encode data information into images and graphs to improve our understanding of data. Computer science, mathematics, cognitive and perceptual science, and physics techniques are often transformed into various visualization problems. This introductory course covers topics in many visualization sub-fields including information visualization and scientific visualization, and aims to show students how data visualization can help find solutions to practical problems in the process of data analysis in various fields. Through this course, students will be familiar with some visualization techniques and methods for displaying different types of data, and cultivate the ability to quickly use visualization-based methods to respond to problems when they encounter actual problems.",
    "zh": "对来自各个学科的数据所有者来讲，为了验证推论或者发现新的信息，可视化已经成为帮助他们理解并展示数据的有力手段。可视化的逻辑是通过视觉感知通道利用我们的解释能力，并将数据的信息编码成图像和图，以提高我们对数据的理解。计算机科学，数学，认知和感知科学以及物理学的技术都常常转化为各种可视化问题。这个介绍性课程涵盖了包括信息可视化和科学可视化在内的许多可视化子领域的主题，旨在向学生展示数据可视化如何在各个领域的数据分析过程中帮助寻找实际问题的解决方案。通过这门课程，学生们将会熟悉一些展示不同类型数据的可视化技术和方法，并培养在遇到实际的问题的时候能够迅速利用基于可视化的方法对问题做出回应。"
